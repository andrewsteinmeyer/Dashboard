# Dashboard

Kanban style dashboard.  Code included is front-end only.  Backend was written in Javascript, MongoDB and Meteor.js.

## Estimate View

The estimate view was used to keep track of repair estimates.  The cards automatically progress through the columns as the status is updated.  When the estimate turns into a work order, the card moves from this screeen to the work order view.
