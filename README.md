# Dashboard

Kanban style dashboard.  Code included is front-end only.  Backend was written in Javascript, MongoDB and Meteor.js.

## Estimate View

The estimate view was used to keep track of repair estimates.  The cards automatically progress through the columns as the status is updated.  When the estimate turns into a work order, the card moves from this screeen to the work order view.

## Workorder View

The workorder view was used by the field and territory managers to manage jobs that were in progress.  The cards update as items are marked off on each repair job.
